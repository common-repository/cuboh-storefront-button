Takes customers directly to your Cuboh storefront.

== Description ==

The Cuboh Storefront is a free-to-try, no-hassle tool to get online ordering set up on your restaurant's website in a manner of minutes.

This means you can:

1. Allow customers to **order directly from your restaurant's website** for pickup, eliminating the need for phone orders or third-party apps.
2. **Process payments with minimal fees.** The only fee you'll incur is a small (usually 2-3%) transaction fee through Stripe. Stripe processes all fees from online ordering. A 5% platform fee will be charged to the customer placing the order on your site.
3. Enjoy **no-commission orders** through the Cuboh Storefront. Don't like third-party fees on your sales? Cuboh Storefront saves your wallet from unwanted tacked-on costs.
4. **Get help setting up the ordering link** for your website. After that, all you have to do is sign up for a Stripe account to process payments.
5. **Duplicate your existing menu** from a pre-existing POS or delivery app - no wasted time recreating (or re-recreating, and so on) menus. It's as simple as importing a menu - and there's loads of support for those in need.

It may already be apparent to some, but the Cuboh Storefront is a straightforward tool with a swathe of excellent features on offer. 

**Why Should I Use The Cuboh Storefront?**
The Cuboh Storefront lets you process payments like a twenty-first century restaurant. But several other services out there boast the same thing; so what sets the Cuboh Storefront apart?

We don't charge excess fees, we offer boatloads of support, and have a variety of other helpful tools that integrate seamlessly with the Storefront.

This plugin adds a customizable button to take customers directly to your Cuboh Storefront.

== Installation ==
